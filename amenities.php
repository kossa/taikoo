              <h4>Backed by Swire Properties' established tradition of impeccable service, the 28-storey Taikoo Place Apartments presents 111 exclusive homes optimized for comfort, space and efficiency. </h4>
              <p>The building's podium façade—a striking juxtaposition of glass, stone, and aluminum provides visibility for the restaurant and privacy for the residential lobby simultaneously.</p>
              <p>The residential lobby creates a monolithic, quiet, and elegant space contrasting the active street, using hand carved graphite stone for the walls, high quality European wood flooring, and a magnificent chandelier that is soft and welcoming. The funnel shape of the lobby creates a natural movement towards the elevators whilst transforming the speed of the street to a slow passage. The podium is truly brought to life by the clubhouse balcony, defined by the sculptural stone benches and private outdoor dining. The restaurant which is shrouded by glass, is activated by balconies and outdoor seating on Tong Chong Street. A portal on the second floor opens up the restaurant to a pedestrian promenade below.</p>
              <p>From the sophisticated residences, to the finest amenities, to the efficient service, Taikoo Place Apartments brings contemporary comfort at its best to Taikoo Place within a single, unforgettable location.</p>
