              <h4>Backed by Swire Properties’ established tradition of impeccable service, the 28-storey Taikoo Place Apartments presents 111 exclusive homes optimised for comfort, space and efficiency. </h4>
              <p>The building’s podium façade — a striking juxtaposition of glass, stone, and aluminium provides visibility for the restaurant and privacy for the residential lobby simultaneously. The residential lobby creates a monolithic, quiet, and elegant space contrasting the active street, using hand carved graphite stone for the walls, high quality European wood flooring, and a magnificent chandelier that is soft and welcoming. The funnel shape of the lobby creates a natural movement towards the elevators whilst transforming the speed of the street to a slow passage. The podium is truly brought to life by the clubhouse balcony, defined by the sculptural stone benches and private outdoor dining.</p>
              
              <p>From the sophisticated residences, to the finest amenities, to the efficient service, Taikoo Place Apartments brings contemporary comfort at its best to Taikoo Place within a single, unforgettable location.</p>
